# Blocks

## A Data Structures and Algorithms library

### Please note that the name of this library was changed from _Telemetry_ to _Blocks_ to avoid confusion w.r.t. my blog project. I'm working on slowwwwwwwly updating this repository to make sure the name change reflects everywhere. Baby steps.

<br>
A Data Structures and Algorithms library intended to replicate the major functionality of the STL, in a simplified form.

## Features

This library implements (_will implement_...) **Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues (with Trees in the works)** along with the major operations supported by each of them. 

<br>

## Instructions

To use the header files in the current directory structure, first, fork the repository.

1. Now, ensure that you are in the workspace directory, `telemetry`. Inside the subdirectory named `telemetry` is where the code and examples reside. Whenever we're compiling new code, it's easiest to compile while `cd`'d into this directory so we can track where we are.

2. Now, ensure that the source .cpp files to compile are in the `examples` subdirectory. 

3. Then, run the following command: <br> `g++ -I include examples\example_name.cpp -o examples\example_name`

The `-I include` option specifies that the header files to include are in the `include` folder. `examples\example_name.cpp` specifies that the file to be compiled, `example_name.cpp`, is inside `examples`. 

**Note:**
There could be some compatibility issues at this stage. Please ensure that your C++ compiler supports C++ 11 features. It is recommended that you run the following command to set the compiler flags correctly.

`g++ -std=c++11 -I include examples\example_name.cpp -o examples\example_name`

If all else fails then the latest version of MinGW that is compatible with C++ 11 will have to installed. 

## TODO's

1. Implement **Trees**, starting with Binary Trees.
2. ~~Start working on Algorithms (Start with the List::Contains function).~~
3. Read about and implement testing methods. 
4. Implement a way to _time_ execution, for comparison with STL functions.

## Looking to contribute?

Fork the repository and follow the instructions above to make sure everything is set up right.

Then, make a new branch on your local repository to commit to, and look for issues opened in this repository on GitHub.

This section will evolve slowly with better instructions. (Can you help fix it? Please come on board with your ideas! ðŸ˜„)
